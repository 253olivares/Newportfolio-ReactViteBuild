# React Portfolio

This is my personal react portfolio. Project began early march to create a new and updated portfolio and showcase my skills and work. Repository and idea began early February but the framework and code needed to create and portfolio page I want was still a work in progress since I was still working on building my react skills.

The project utilizes the following dependencies.

- emailjs
- animate.css
- tailwind.css
- React-spring
- React Router
- React loadable
- sass

Project is planned to be responsive to be visible on mobile devices.

Mobile design is currently not available but will be in the future.
